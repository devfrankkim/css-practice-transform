## Key concepts I have learned from building the app

- [x] Span doesn't work with margins
- [x] Flexbox also needs heights for the parents and itself.
- [x] Giving height is crucial for moving items.

```
Unlike div, p  which are Block Level elements which can take up margin on all sides,

span cannot as it's an Inline element which takes up margins horizontally only.

Solution? 
Make your span element =>
display: inline-block; 
or 
display: block;
```
